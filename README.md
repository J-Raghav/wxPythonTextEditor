It is my first project using wxPython and for now it only have following features
  1.new,open,save,saveas
  2.It does not have change tracking feature it assumes all opened file are saved file
  3.It can save state of all files which are opened in past I implemented it using json file
    storing values of File object 
Plans for next version:-
  1.I am not satisfied with current relationship between File and MyWindow class I plan to 
    change in future
  2.planning to implement chnge tracking feature
  3.adding multiple tabs
